# About this project
This is my interpretation of a frontend mentor challenge, which you can find 
[here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3)

The challenge is to build out a multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I aimed for a pixel perfect duplication of the provided figma design files, which include designs for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

Project built with Next.js, TypeScript, Swiper.js.

Please try out the [deployment](https://fem-space-tourism-website-beryl.vercel.app/) which is hosted on vercel.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
